<h2>Rent a Car</h2>

This is a project that simulates a car rental website.

Through javascript resources it is possible to choose how many days you want to keep the car and what mileage it will be and select the chosen car category.

You can see the project done here: https://felipeizidoro.github.io/Rent-a-Car/
